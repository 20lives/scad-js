**OpenSCAD** is an amazing software for creating solid 3D CAD objects, but modeling with the **OpenSCAD** language can be really cumbersome and limited.

**scad-js** overcomes these limitations with the power of Javascript.

## Getting started
First make sure you have [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) installed on your system, we will use it to visualize the model.

clone [scad-js-starter](https://github.com/scad-js/scad-js-starter):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/20lives/scad-js-starter.git my-scad-js-project
cd my-scad-js-project
```

install dependencies and run develpment script:

```bash
yarn # or npm install
yarn dev # or npm run dev
```

Now open `index.js` in your favourite text editor and start tinkering.
